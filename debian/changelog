ros-melodic-panda-moveit-config (0.7.7-1bionic) bionic; urgency=high

  * Thorough rework based on franka_description 0.9.1 (using fine and coarse collision models)
    The internal robot controller uses coarse collision models for self-collision checking.
    In MoveIt, these coarse models should be used for self-collision checking only as well.
    Particularly, these coarse models should not be used for collision checking with the environment.
  * Adapt ACM configuration to Melodic
    Melodic's srdfdom/MoveIt don't support tags <disable_default_collisions> and <enable_collisions>.
  * Remove adapter ResolveConstraintFrames
    as it's not implemented in Melodic
