ros-noetic-panda-moveit-config (0.8.0-1focal) focal; urgency=high

  * Thorough rework based on franka_description 0.9.1 (using fine and coarse collision models)
    The internal robot controller uses coarse collision models for self-collision checking.
    In MoveIt, these coarse models should be used for self-collision checking only as well.
    Particularly, these coarse models should not be used for collision checking with the environment.
